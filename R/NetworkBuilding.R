## MAIN FUNCTIONS THAT COMPUTE THE NETWORK FROM THE BASE ##

#' Compute the adjacency matrix of a network from its edgelist
#'
#' @param edgelist (data.table) A table containing the edges (or links) of the
#'     network, i.e. representing the movements of subjects between
#'     facilities. Either in long format with at least two columns (origin and
#'     target facilities of a link), each row corresponding to a single
#'     movement, or aggregated by unique pairs of origin/target, therefore with
#'     an additional variable for movements count (default). See details.
#' @param origin_name (character) Column of the origin facilities of the links.
#' @param target_name (character) Column of the target facilities of the links.
#' @param count (character) Column of the counts of movements by unique pair of
#'     facilities.
#' @param format_long (logical) Whether the edgelist is in long format, with
#'     each row corresponding to a single movement. If TRUE, the edgelist will
#'     be aggregated by unique pairs of facilities to compute the matrix.
#' @return A square numeric matrix, the adjacency matrix of the network.
#' @details The edgelist contains the information on the connections between
#'     nodes of the network, that is the movements of subjects between
#'     facilities. The edgelist can be in two different formats: long or
#'     aggregated. In long format, each row corresponds to a single movement
#'     between two facilities, therefore only two columns are needed, one
#'     containing the origin facilities of a movement, the other containing the
#'     target facilities. In aggregated format, the edgelist is aggregated by
#'     unique pairs of origin-target facilities. Thus, each row corresponds to a
#'     unique connection between two facilities, and the table contains an
#'     additional variable which is the count of the number of movements
#'     recorded for the pair. If the edgelist is provided in long format, it
#'     will be aggregated to compute the matrix.

#' Compute the edgelist of a network from a database of movements records.
#'
#' This function computes the edgelist of a network of facilities across
#' which subjects can be transferred. The edgelist is computed from a database that
#' contains the records of the subjects' stays in the facilities.
#'
#' @param base (data.table) A database of records of stays of subjects in
#'     facilities. The table should have at least the following columns:
#'     \itemize{ \item\bold{subjectID} (character) unique subject identifier
#'     \item\bold{facilityID} (character) unique facility identifier
#'     \item\bold{admDate} (POSIXct) date of admission in the facility
#'     \item\bold{disDate} (POSIXct) date of discharge of the facility }
#' @param window_threshold (integer) A number of days. If two stays of a subject
#'     at two facilities occurred within this window, this constitutes a
#'     connection between the two facilities (given that potential other
#'     conditions are met).
#' @param count_option (character) How to count connections. Either "successive"
#'     or "all". See details.
#' @param condition (character) Condition(s) used to decide what constitutes a
#'     connection. Can be "dates", "flags", or "both". See details.
#' @param noloops (boolean). Should transfers within the same nodes (loops) be
#'     kept or set to 0. Defaults to TRUE, removing loops (setting matrix
#'     diagonal to 0).
#' @param nmoves_threshold (numeric) A threshold for the minimum number of
#'     subject transfer between two facilities. Set to NULL to deactivate,
#'     default to NULL.
#' @param flag_vars (list) Additional variables that can help flag a transfer,
#'     besides the dates of admission and discharge. Must be a named list of two
#'     character vectors which are the names of the columns that can flag a
#'     transfer: the column that can flag a potential origin, and the column
#'     that can flag a potential target. The list must be named with "origin"
#'     and "transfer". Eg: list("origin" = "var1", "target" = "var2"). See
#'     details.
#' @param flag_values (list) A named list of two character vectors which contain
#'     the values of the variables in flag_var that are matched to flag a
#'     potential transfer. The list must be named with "origin" and
#'     "transfer". The character vectors might be of length greater than
#'     one. Eg: list("origin" = c("value1", "value2"), "target" = c("value2",
#'     "value2")). The values in 'origin' and 'target' are the values that flag
#'     a potential origin of a transfer, or a potential target,
#'     respectively. See details.
#' @param verbose TRUE to print computation steps
#'
#' @return A list of two data.tables, which are the edgelists. One in long
#'     format (el_long), and one aggregated by pair of nodes (el_aggr).

#' @param flag_values (list) A named list of two character vectors which contain
#'     the values of the variables in flag_var that are matched to flag a
#'     potential transfer. The list must be named with "origin" and
#'     "transfer". The character vectors might be of length greater than
#'     one. Eg: list("origin" = c("value1", "value2"), "target" = c("value2",
#'     "value2")). The values in 'origin' and 'target' are the values that flag
#'     a potential origin of a transfer, or a potential target,
#'     respectively. See details.
#' @param create_MetricsTable (boolean)
#'     Should the metrics table be created along with the network. Setting to FALSE will speed up the results. Default is TRUE.
#' @param ... Additional parameters to be sent to checkBase in case the database has not been checked yet.
#' @param verbose TRUE to print computation steps
#' @param shinySession (NULL) internal variable to deal with the progress bar

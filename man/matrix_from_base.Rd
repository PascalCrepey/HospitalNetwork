\title{Compute the adjacency matrix of a network from a database of movements records.}
\usage{
matrix_from_base(
  base,
  window_threshold = 365,
  count_option = "successive",
  prob_params = c(0.0036, 1/365, 0.128),

}
\arguments{
\item{base}{(data.table) A database of records of stays of subjects in
facilities. The table should have at least the following columns:
\itemize{ \item\bold{subjectID} (character) unique subject identifier
\item\bold{facilityID} (character) unique facility identifier
\item\bold{admDate} (POSIXct) date of admission in the facility
\item\bold{disDate} (POSIXct) date of discharge of the facility }}

\item{window_threshold}{(integer) A number of days. If two stays of a subject
at two facilities occurred within this window, this constitutes a
connection between the two facilities (given that potential other
conditions are met).}

\item{count_option}{(character) How to count connections. Options are 
"successive", "probability" or "all". See details.}

\item{prob_params}{(vector of numeric) Three numerical values to calculate 
the probability that a movement causes an introduction from hospital A 
to hospital B. See Donker et al. (PLoS CB 2010) for more details. 
For use with count_option="probability".
prob_params[1] is the rate of acquisition in hospital A (related to LOS 
in hospital A). Default: 0.0036
prob_params[2] is the rate of loss of colonisation (related to time 
between admissions). Default: 1/365
prob_params[4] is the rate of transmission to other patients in hospital 
B (related to LOS in hospital B). Default: 0.128}

\item{condition}{(character) Condition(s) used to decide what constitutes a
connection. Can be "dates", "flags", or "both". See details.}

\item{noloops}{(boolean). Should transfers within the same nodes (loops) be
kept or set to 0. Defaults to TRUE, removing loops (setting matrix
diagonal to 0).}

\item{nmoves_threshold}{(numeric) A threshold for the minimum number of
subject transfer between two facilities. Set to NULL to deactivate,
default to NULL.}

\item{flag_vars}{(list) Additional variables that can help flag a transfer,
besides the dates of admission and discharge. Must be a named list of two
character vectors which are the names of the columns that can flag a
transfer: the column that can flag a potential origin, and the column
that can flag a potential target. The list must be named with "origin"
and "transfer". Eg: list("origin" = "var1", "target" = "var2"). See
details.}

\item{flag_values}{(list) A named list of two character vectors which contain
the values of the variables in flag_var that are matched to flag a
potential transfer. The list must be named with "origin" and
"transfer". The character vectors might be of length greater than
one. Eg: list("origin" = c("value1", "value2"), "target" = c("value2",
"value2")). The values in 'origin' and 'target' are the values that flag
a potential origin of a transfer, or a potential target,
respectively. See details.}

\item{verbose}{TRUE to print computation steps}
}
\value{
A square matrix, the adjacency matrix of the network.
}
\description{
This function computes the adjacency matrix of a network of facilities across
which subjects can be transferred. The matrix is computed from a database that
contains the records of the subjects' stays in the facilities. This function
is a simple wrapper around the two functions
\code{\link{edgelist_from_base}}, which computes the edgelist of the network
from the database, and \code{\link{matrix_from_edgelist}}, which converts the
edgelist into the adjacency matrix.

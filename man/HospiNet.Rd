\section{Methods}{

\describe{
  \item{\code{new(edgelist, 
window_threshold,
nmoves_threshold,
noloops)}}{This method is used to create an object of this class with \code{edgelist} as the necessary information to create the network.
The other arguments \code{window_threshold}, \code{nmoves_threshold}, and \code{noloops} are specific to the \code{edgelist} and need to be provided.
For ease of use, it is preferable to use the function \code{\link{hospinet_from_subject_database}}}
  \item{\code{print()}}{This method prints basic information about the object.}
  \item{\code{plot(type = "matrix")}}{This method plots the network matrix by default. 
  The argument \code{type} can take the following values: 
  \describe{
  \item{matrix}{plot the network matrix,}
  \item{clustered_matrix}{identify and plot cluster(s) in the matrix using the infomap algorithm (from igraph),}
  \item{degree}{plot the histogram of the number of neighbors by facility,}
  \item{circular_network}{plot the network by clusters using a "spaghetti-like" layout. Only works when there are at least 2 clusters.}
  }
